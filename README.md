# url-handler

This is a handy script to override default http handler to correctly send urls to spotify. This is useful when clicking a spotify link in Telegram, for example.

If your default web browser is not firefox, change the last line of the desktop file to:

```bash
X-Browser=<browser>.desktop
```
